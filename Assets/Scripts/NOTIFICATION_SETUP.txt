# Setting Up Notification Sounds

To add notification sounds for goal reminders:

1. Create a `Resources` folder in your Unity project if it doesn't exist
2. Create a `Sounds` folder inside the `Resources` folder
3. Add an audio file named `notification.mp3` (or other supported format) to the `Sounds` folder
4. The system will automatically load this sound for notifications

Example folder structure:
```
Assets/
  Resources/
    Sounds/
      notification.mp3
```

The ChatManager script will automatically try to load this sound file for goal reminders.
If the file is not found, a warning will be logged in the console, but the system will continue to function without sound notifications.
